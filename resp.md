What you really want is not “constant angular resolution” (your sensor already gives you that), but **constant spatial** resolution—i.e. so that a 1 m-wide object at 2 m and a 1 m-wide object at 10 m both cover ≈ the same number of samples in your 1D signal. Resampling your raw LiDAR sweep so that the distance between adjacent points corresponds to a fixed *arc-length* Δs can indeed help your CNN see every pallet “at the same scale.” Here’s how you might do it:

---

## 1. Understand the geometry

* Your sensor gives you ranges $r_i$ at evenly spaced angles $\theta_i = i\cdot\Delta\theta$.
* The *spatial* distance between rays at range $r$ is

  $$
    \Delta s(r) \;=\; r \,\Delta\theta.
  $$
* Close by, $\Delta s$ is small ⇒ high spatial resolution; far away, $\Delta s$ is large ⇒ low spatial resolution.

What you’d like is to build a new 1D signal $f(s)$ sampled at

$$
  s_k = k\,\Delta s_{\rm target},
  \quad
  k = 0,1,\dots,K-1,
$$

so that every meter in the world corresponds to exactly $\tfrac1{\Delta s_{\rm target}}$ samples, independent of range.

---

## 2. Warping & interpolation

1. **Compute your original “position” axis**
   For each ray $i$, define its cumulative arc-length

   $$
     S_i = \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} r_j\,\Delta\theta.
   $$

   (You can think of $S_i$ as “how far along the circular scan” you are.)

2. **Choose a target spatial step** $\Delta s_{\rm target}$
   If you want, e.g.\ 100 points per meter, set $\Delta s_{\rm target}=0.01\,\mathrm{m}$.

3. **Define the new sample points**

   $$
     s_k = k\,\Delta s_{\rm target},\quad k=0,\dots,K-1
   $$

   where $K\approx S_{N-1}/\Delta s_{\rm target}$.

4. **Linearly interpolate** your original range signal $r_i$ from $S_i$ to $s_k$.
   In PyTorch/Numpy:

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   # original:
   r = np.array(scan)            # shape (N,)
   theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, N, endpoint=False)
   S = np.cumsum(r * (theta[1]-theta[0]))  # shape (N,)

   # new axis:
   ds = 0.01                       # desired 1 cm spatial resolution
   s_new = np.arange(0, S[-1], ds)

   # interpolate:
   r_resampled = np.interp(s_new, S, r)
   ```

   Now `r_resampled` is your 1D signal with *constant* spatial resolution.

## 3. Pros & cons

* **Pros**

  * A pallet of fixed width will always occupy \~the same number of samples, so a standard Conv1D will see it at the same “scale.”
  * You remove one source of variation (object size in samples) before learning.

* **Cons**

  * You’re warping the entire scan non-linearly—small errors or noise in $r$ get “stretched.”
  * You lose the “global” circular structure; downstream layers only see the new linearized axis.
  * Interpolation adds smoothing/aliasing; you may need a higher-order filter if that matters.

---

## 4. Alternatives

1. **ROI warp only.** If you know roughly where the pallet is (e.g. via a quick range threshold or Hough transform), extract that angular window and resample *only* that segment to a fixed length.
2. **Depth-aware convolution.** Let the network dynamically adjust its dilation or kernel size based on range—for instance by feeding $1/r$ or $\log r$ as a secondary input channel and using it to modulate filter dilation.
3. **Multi-scale/dilated blocks.** As before, use parallel conv-branches at different dilations and max-pool across them, so the network itself can choose the “right” scale.

---

### Bottom line

Yes—**resampling to constant spatial resolution** (what you called “same angular resolution everywhere”) is a perfectly reasonable pre-processing step if you want a vanilla Conv1D to see objects at the same sample-width regardless of distance. Just be mindful of interpolation artifacts, and consider doing it only on the regions of interest (or in combination with depth-aware architectural tricks) to keep the rest of your scan intact.
